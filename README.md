Dad Jokes

A dad joke is a short joke, typically a pun, presented as a one-liner or a question and answer, but not a narrative. Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are stereotypically told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its overly-simplistic humor.

Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humor from an intentionally unfunny punchline.
